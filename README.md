# SimpleVulkanEngineCPP

This is a Simple Vulkan Renderer I have implemented for learning Vulkan. Only runs in Windows. To run the project:

1. Download and Install Visual Studio Community Edition.
2. Download and install Vulkan SDK from LunarG.
3. Finally, add the locations of your 'Include' and 'Bin' folder inside Vulkan SDK Install Folder to Additional Include Directories and Additional Libraries inside project settings of Visual Studio.

All other dependencies are included in the repo.
